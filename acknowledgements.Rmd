# Acknowledgements

I'd like to thank my advisor, Hyo Gweon, and my collaborator, Sophie Bridgers for their guidance, encouragement, mentorship, and excellent discussions. I'm so grateful to have gotten to spend the past two years working with such brilliant and thoughtful women. 

Thank you also to my second reader, Mike Frank, for the helpful comments and whose class taught me that everything is easier in RMarkdown.

Thanks also to the many different research assistants and one lab manager who helped with data collection: Fernanda Kramer, Maria Marta Rey Malca De Habich, Natalie Wu, Huda Akef, Ayushi Chandaria, and Grace Bennett-Pierre.
