# Introduction

Humans are willing to help others from a relatively young age (*citation*)

# Experiment 1

We presented children with a situation in which there were multiple ways to help another person. We manipulated the likely cause of the person in need of help's failure, which made one course of action more helpful than another. 

## Methods

### Participants
